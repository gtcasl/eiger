Version 2.1
-----------
This version adds support for PAPI hardware performance counters within lwperf.
Using PAPI allows for collecting data to generate models of arbitrary hardware
counters in addition to time, such as power or energy. To use, ensure that
USE_PAPI is defined in the preprocessor before including lwperf.h.
