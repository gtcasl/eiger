Version 3.0
-----------
This version is backwards-incompatible with previous releases of Eiger, due to
the following changes:
    * Move from MySQL to sqlite3 as database host. There is a script
      facilitating the conversion of existing MySQL databases to sqlite3
      database files in the database folder.
    * Removal of 'result' metric types. All nondeterministic metrics are
      considered dependent upon the exact execution of an application on a
      specific machine. Therefore artifacts such as execution time, previously
      catagorized specially as 'result' metrics, are just another
      nondeterministic metric.

Version 2.1
-----------
This version adds support for PAPI hardware performance counters within lwperf.
Using PAPI allows for collecting data to generate models of arbitrary hardware
counters in addition to time, such as power or energy. To use, ensure that
USE_PAPI is defined in the preprocessor before including lwperf.h.
