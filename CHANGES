Version 4.0
-----------
This version changes the command-line interface to Eiger using a series of
subcommands.  In addition, there is now expanded support for outputting data
for use in external tools and a way to reintroduce externally-generated models
into the Eiger database.

There is now a new JSON format for Eiger models. This makes the generated model
more user-readable. There is functionality to convert inbetween the JSON and
bespoke versions of models.

Version 3.0
-----------
This version is backwards-incompatible with previous releases of Eiger, due to
the following changes:
    * Move from MySQL to sqlite3 as database host. There is a script
      facilitating the conversion of existing MySQL databases to sqlite3
      database files in the database folder.
    * Removal of 'result' metric types. All nondeterministic metrics are
      considered dependent upon the exact execution of an application on a
      specific machine. Therefore artifacts such as execution time, previously
      catagorized specially as 'result' metrics, are just another
      nondeterministic metric.
    * Removal of the Execution API object. This was used to allow for data from
      multiple sources to be joined in the creation of a single Trial. This
      distinction is a function of the application code, not of the database,
      and is being removed for clarity. Any merging of separate sources will
      need to be handled on an application basis.
    * lwperf has moved to its own repository: github.com/gtcasl/lwperf

Version 2.1
-----------
This version adds support for PAPI hardware performance counters within lwperf.
Using PAPI allows for collecting data to generate models of arbitrary hardware
counters in addition to time, such as power or energy. To use, ensure that
USE_PAPI is defined in the preprocessor before including lwperf.h.
