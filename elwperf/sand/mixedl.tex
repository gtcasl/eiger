There is nothing in principle that prevents using lwperf in an application with mixed C/C++/Fortran sources.
In practice, the code generating scripts assume a single list of files in the corresponding language can
be searched with grep for all the profiling sites. Converting updateLoggersF90.sh to updateLoggersMixed.sh
is an exercise left to the reader.
