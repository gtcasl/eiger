There are several tasks of minor housekeeping or performance value:
\begin{itemize}

\item Put all the collector related items into a separate c++ namespace. At present, Perf and EigerPerf classnames and lwperf prefix are used.

\item Modify the update scripts to accept an argument list instead of computing
the list of files based on suffix with ls.

\item Add dumping to memory buffer (ostringstream) and flush to disk on some schedule rather than i/o at each time a PERFSTOP is reached. In principle, a reasonable OS is already doing this for us, but in practice the buffer size is likely to be smaller than we might like.

\item Modify non-eiger stringOptions semantics to put all files in a subdirectory, as noted in aperf.cpp.

\item Revisit using a map instead of an array for the log index in Perf and EigerPerf classes.

\item Revisit adding a flag to eliminate MPI-dependence and add boost dependency for timing. Not terribly interesting for HPC purposes, where MPI is a given.
\end{itemize}

\section{Postscript}

A rose by any other name would still be thorny. Abandon all hope ye who seek GUIs (and learn to script a plotter).
