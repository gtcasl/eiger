The driving need for this tool is portability: numerous superior (and heavy-weight) but proprietary performance analysis tools exist. As with mini-applications, we need mini-analysis tools.
Free MPI-oriented profiling tools already exist, but they usually stop at profiling communications and do not collect the parameters that control local workloads. Source-level insight is required to identify and capture the influential parameters.
