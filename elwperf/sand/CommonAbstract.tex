We report on the use and design of a portable, extensible performance data collection tool motivated by modeling needs of the high performance computing systems co-design community. The lightweight performance data collectors with Eiger support is intended to be a tailorable tool, not a shrink-wrapped library product, as profiling needs vary widely. A single code markup scheme is reported which, based on compilation flags, can send performance data from parallel applications to CSV files, to an Eiger mysql database, or (in a non-database environment) to flat files for later merging and loading on a host with mysql available. The tool supports C, C++, and Fortran applications.
