Interface with PAPI:
Initialize PAPI library and set up eventsets.
    Should happen in PERF::init().
Specify metrics to be recorded, and their types, probably at compile-time.
    All nondeterministic.
Call PAPI_start in formatter.h::start() and PAPI_stop in formatter.h::stop()
    'put' all read counters.
Make sure that when we try and init the counters, if a counter doesn't exist we blow up.
Add PAPI to build requirements of lwperf.
