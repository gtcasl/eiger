Eiger Performance Modeling Framework


=============
OVERVIEW
=============
This document gives a brief overview into the stucture and installation of the Eiger 
performance modeling framework. More details can be found in the documentation folder.

=============
FOLDER LAYOUT
=============
./api			- The Eiger C++ API
./database		- MySQL schema for Eiger database
./documentation - Documentation describing the implementation of Eiger
./eiger			- Eiger performance modeling framework
./elwperf		- Sandia's Fortran and C/C++ macro interface for common profiling tasks
./examples		- Examples of basic modeling functionality
./ocelot-trace	- GPU Ocelot trace generators with Eiger interface
./tests         - Simple tests ensuring correct installation of Eiger 


Please review the requirements specification in the ./documentation folder for all
required software packages.

=============
USAGE
=============
All metric collection, model generation, polling, serialization, and reporting
functionality can be installed with the following command:

python setup.py install

They can be controlled by the
Eiger.py script; more information can be found by entering the following 
command after installing:

Eiger.py -h

As well, the Eiger module can be imported and used to issue any of the same
commands used by the command line script. Examples of basic modeling functions
can be found in the ./examples folder.

=============
DATABASE SETUP
=============
The Eiger modeling framework relies upon a MySQL relational database to manage metric
storage, model construction, and model serialization. Read and write access must be
available for a database server, although there is no limitation as to the location
of the database (ie remote vs. local). To initialize a new database, open a MySQL
client and enter the following commands:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE MyEigerDatabase; 
mysql> USE MyEigerDatabase;
mysql> SOURCE /path/to/eiger/database/schema.sql;

At this point the database named 'MyEigerDatabase' now contains all necessary tables
used by Eiger.

=============
API INSTALLATION
============= 
The C++ API requires compilation and installation. You may need to specify the
locations of MySQL and MySQL++ in the GNUMakefile in the api directory.

=============
EXAMPLE DATA
=============
Several sets of example data reside in the ./examples subdirectory. This data was used 
for different publications and may or may not retain their functionality as Eiger
is developed.
