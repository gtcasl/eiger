FOLDER LAYOUT
=============
./api			- The Eiger C++ API
./database		- MySQL schema for Eiger database
./documentation - Documentation describing the implementation of Eiger
./eiger			- Eiger performance modeling framework
./examples		- Examples of basic modeling functionality
./ocelot-trace	- GPU Ocelot trace generators with Eiger interface
./tests         - Test datasets
./elwperf	- Sandia's Fortran and C/C++ macro interface for common profiling tasks


Please review the requirements specification in the ./documentation folder for all
required software packages.

=============
USAGE
=============
All metric collection, model generation, polling, serialization, and reporting
functionality can be installed with the following command:

python setup.py install

They can be controlled by the
Eiger.py script; more information can be found by entering the following 
command after installing:

Eiger.py -h

As well, the Eiger module can be imported and used to issue any of the same
commands used by the command line script. Examples of basic modeling functions
can be found in the ./examples folder.

=============
DATABASE SETUP
=============
The Eiger modeling framework relies upon a MySQL relational database to manage metric
storage, model construction, and model serialization. Read and write access must be
available for a database server, although there is no limitation as to the location
of the database (ie remote vs. local). To initialize a new database, open a MySQL
client and enter the following commands:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE MyEigerDatabase; 
mysql> USE MyEigerDatabase;
mysql> SOURCE /path/to/eiger/database/schema.sql;

At this point the database named 'MyEigerDatabase' now contains all necessary tables
used by Eiger.


=============
API AND GENERATOR INSTALLATION
=============
The C++ API and the GPU Ocelot trace generators require compilation and installation.

The C++ API requires MySQL and MySQL++. Set the mysqlLocation and mysqlppLocation paths in
the SConstruct file to point to the appropriate locations on your machine.

The GPU Ocelot trace generators require GPU Ocelot. Make sure gpuocelotLocation in the
SConstruct file points to the appropriate location on your machine.

To build and install the C++ API and the GPUOcelot interface, enter this command:

scons install

This will create dynamic library objects for both the C++ API and the GPU Ocelot trace
generators and install them in /usr/local.

To only build the Eiger C++ API library object, enter this command:

scons install-eiger-only

The Ocelot trace generators library can selected individually, although it requires
the C++ interface. To specify just the trace generator library (should the C++ API
already be installed), enter this command:

scons install-ocelot-only

To specify an install directory other than the default of /usr/local, 
pass the following flag:

scons install -Q PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir

For help, enter:

scons -h

=============
TESTING
=============
Several sets of test data reside in the ./tests subdirectory. This data was used 
for different publications and may or may not retain their functionality as Eiger
is developed.
